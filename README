This is an implementation of Conway's famous Game of Life written in C.
This program makes use of the SDL (Simple Directmedia Library) currently
to provide a cross-platform means for pausing between screen updates.
In the future, it will also be used as a graphical frontend for this
application.

Note that I am obviously not the initial creator of the Game of Life,
and that all credits for having invented it go to John Horton Conway
himself for that. I also do not own any portion of the SDL.

To run this program, you can supply a command line argument.
If you run the program as "gameoflife txt", the game will run in the textual
mode using stdout to print the board. You can also supply "gfx" to use the SDL
version, though this will be the default even if this second argument is not
supplied at all.

This program is free and open source software and you are welcome to
download, use, modify, and distribute it under the terms of the GPL.

Note that, under Windows, you may wish to use MSys with MinGW in order
to compile this program using the Makefile provided. You will also need
to manually install the SDL.  For *nix users, you should be able to 
simply run make on the Makefile immediately as most distributions come
with make built in.  To get the SDL, you may (under Linux) simply have
to run the command to install (via your package manager) libsdl1.2-dev.
